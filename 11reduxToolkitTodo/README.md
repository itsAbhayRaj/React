## ReduxToolkit
### ```React-redux and Redux\toolkit```

- Store Configuration 
- Slices ( diff<sup>n</sup> features )
- _createSlice_

- object in createSlice
    - name
    - initial state
    - reducers (`Key:Function onject`)
     
## Reducers
_Do actual work_
- state , action
 

export reducer as slice.reducers and reducer functions as slice.actions


#### Now we have useDispatch and useSelector in React-redux

useDispatch(functions from reducer)
useSelector( state => return state.properties)
